# Fractals

A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript web-application that renders randomized fractals based on number of branches and spread. Utilizes the Canvas API in HTML and math operators in JavaScript to create symmetrical angles. 

## Installation

Fork this repository and run it in your local dev environment.

## Usage

Made for fun! You can tinker with the Effects Settings on the side and learn how each parent and child fractal branch is rendered. There is a randomize button to see what the script comes up with and a reset button to return to the default values.

## Optimization

My default Effects Settings are optimized to run on my computer. Depending on your computer specs, the fractals may take a couple of seconds to load. In your local environment, if you'd like to optimize the render time then I do suggest adjusting the maxLevels value. If you're still having trouble, I also recommend possibly lowering the sides or adjusting the shadows if you're having difficulty loading your fractals.
